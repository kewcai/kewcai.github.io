      <description>In this first project, I want to explore image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are a type of neural network that has been proven to work well with image data since they account for the fact that adjacent pixels share similar properties and allows the image to be downsampled without losing valuable information. This approach was first presented by Yann LeCun et al (1998) using LeNet-5 to classify handwritten digits.</description>
